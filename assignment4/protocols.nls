; This file contains all protocols. Given a protocol, a bus can 'lead'
; or 'follow'. 'Follow' means it responds according to the protocol to
; an incoming message. 'Lead' means it takes action according to the
; protocol, not being prompted by an incoming message. Accordingly,
; for each protocol, for instance 'overloaded', there is a lead
; procedure `lead-overloaded` and a follow function `follow-overloaded`.
